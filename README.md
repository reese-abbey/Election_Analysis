Dear Election Commission:
  Included in this letter is the python script that can be used as a base for any upcoming election. Changing out the CSV for the new associated data (in the same format) should return the outcomes for the provided information in upcoming elections. Please let me know if you have any issues or if something needs to be changed or updated to reflect new information or new data that you would like to be accessed. 
  Thanks, your python friend.
